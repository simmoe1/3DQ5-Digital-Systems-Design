## VGA Interface and Timing in Digital Systems

<a name="objective"></a>
### Objective

To design and implement a digital system synchronized with an external device. To understand the video graphics array (VGA) interface, which is the main display interface used for personal computers (PCs).

### Preparation

* Revise the first two labs and the programmable logic fabric, i.e., logic elements (LEs)
* Get familiarized with the source code and the in-lab experiments for this lab

### In-lab experiments

- [Experiment 1](experiment1/doc/experiment1.md)
- [Experiment 2](experiment2/doc/experiment2.md)
- [Experiment 3](experiment3/doc/experiment3.md)
- [Experiment 4](experiment4/doc/experiment4.md)

### Evaluation

Take-home exercise (due 14 hours before the next lab is scheduled):

- [Exercise](exercise/doc/exercise.md) (has a weight of 3% of your final grade)

### Online workflow

- [Simulation of video frames](vga-simulation.md)
