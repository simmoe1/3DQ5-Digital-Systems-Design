## Embedded Memories and an External SRAM Interface

<a name="objective"></a>
### Objective

To understand how to build and simulate a digital system containing embedded memory blocks, such as read-only memory (ROM), single-port random access memory (RAM), and dual-port RAM. To gain experience with design verification using SystemVerilog testbenches and the ModelSim simulation environment. To design and implement a self-test engine for an external static RAM (SRAM) memory.

### Preparation

* Revise the first three labs
* Get familiarized with the source code and the in-lab experiments for this lab

### In-lab experiments

- [Experiment 1](experiment1/doc/experiment1.md)
- [Experiment 2](experiment2/doc/experiment2.md)
- [Experiment 3](experiment3/doc/experiment3.md)
- [Experiment 4](experiment4/doc/experiment4.md)

### Evaluation

Take-home exercises (due 14 hours before the next lab is scheduled):

- [Exercise 1](exercise1/doc/exercise1.md) (has a weight of 3% of your final grade)
- [Exercise 2](exercise2/doc/exercise2.md) (has a weight of 2% of your final grade)
