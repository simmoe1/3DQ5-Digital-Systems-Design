### Experiment 2

In this experiment you will get familiarized with the 7-segment-display and priority encoders. 

In subfolder **experiment2/rtl** you will find two design files associate with the project files from **experiment2/syn**. The `qsf` file contains all the project settings, including the pin assignments. The `qpf` file is the project file to be opened in Quartus (the same is followed in the remaining experiments). 

The *convert\_hex\_to\_seven\_segment* Verilog file contains the logic circuit for converting a 4-bit signal representing a hex number to the 7 signals required to control the LEDs of the 7-segment-display. Note, the LEDs of the 7-segment-display are active low. The truth tables of the 7 logic equations are not given in this document, however they can be “reverse engineered” from the `case` statement from the *convert\_hex\_to\_seven\_segment* design file. Since there are 7 logic functions with 4 inputs each, the implementation of this `case` statement takes only 7 look-up tables (LUTs) in the Cyclone IV device, as shown below.

The priority encoder described in design file experiment2 reads switches 0 to 9 and it encodes the position of the most significant switch (that is turned on) to a 4-bit binary-coded-decimal (BCD) signal called “value”. This value will be passed to the design unit that converts a 4-bit value and passes it to the 7-segment-display. The logic implementation of the priority encoder is shown below. Note, if no switch is turned on then the displayed value will be 4’hF.

You have to perform the following tasks in the lab for this experiment:

* understand the source code and verify if the priority encoder works correctly
* extend the priority encoder to read all the 18 switches from the DE2-115 board and display the position of the most significant switch onto the two rightmost 7-segment-displays in 2-digit BCD format (if all the switches are turned off then display 8’hFF).
