## Introduction to Computer-Aided Design using Verilog

<a name="objective"></a>
### Objective

To understand the fundamental coding templates used in an hardware description language ([HDL](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/what-is-a-hardware-description-language-hdl/)) for combinational and sequential logic circuits, to gain experience with the [Quartus](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/overview.html) design synthesis environment and the [Modelsim](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/model-sim.html) simulation environment, and to implement the hardware designs in the [Cyclone-IV](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/products/programmable/fpga/cyclone-iv.html) field-programmable gate-array ([FPGA](https://www.eetimes.com/all-about-fpgas/)) on the [DE2-115](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=502) board. You will also get familiarized with the directory structure to be used for all the experiments in this course.

### Preparation

* Revise the logic design material and the Quartus design environment
* Read this document, the source code that is released for this lab, and get familiarized with [SystemVerilog] (https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1800-2017.html) language constructs

### In-lab experiments

- [Experiment 1](experiment1/doc/experiment1.md)
- [Experiment 2](experiment2/doc/experiment2.md)
- [Experiment 3](experiment3/doc/experiment3.md)
- [Experiment 4](experiment4/doc/experiment4.md)
- [Experiment 5](experiment5/doc/experiment5.md)

### Evaluation

Take-home exercise (due 14 hours before the next lab is scheduled):

- [Exercise](exercise/doc/exercise.md) (has a weight of 3% of your final grade)

### Online workflow

- [Directory structure](directory-structure.md)
- [Simulation of board events](board-simulation.md)
