## Finite State Machine Design for the PS/2 and LCD Interfaces

<a name="objective"></a>
### Objective

To understand the importance of finite state machines (FSMs) in digital systems design. Gain experience with coding styles for FSMs and implement digital systems using the PS/2 and LCD peripherals on the DE2-115 board. PS/2 is a serial port used to interface a keyboard or a mouse to a personal computer. LCD is a low-power/flat-panel display that uses liquid crystals and it is predominant in embedded devices.

### Preparation

* Revise the first lab and FSMs
* Read this document and get familiarized with the source code and the in-lab experiments

### In-lab experiments

- [Experiment 1](experiment1/doc/experiment1.md)
- [Experiment 2](experiment2/doc/experiment2.md)
- [Experiment 3](experiment3/doc/experiment3.md)
- [Experiment 4](experiment4/doc/experiment4.md)
- [Experiment 5](experiment5/doc/experiment5.md)

### Evaluation

Take-home exercise (due 14 hours before the next lab is scheduled):

- [Exercise](exercise/doc/exercise.md) (has a weight of 3% of your final grade)

### Online workflow

- [Simulation of PS/2 and LCD events](ps2-lcd-simulation.md)
- [PS/2 keyboard codes](ps2-keyboard-codes.md)
- [LCD codes](lcd-codes.md)
