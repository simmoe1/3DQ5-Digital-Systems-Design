## Integrating SRAM, VGA and UART Interfaces

<a name="objective"></a>
### Objective

To gain experience with self-checking testbenches. To design a digital system synchronized to a video graphics array (VGA) interface and an external static random access memory (SRAM). To understand how the universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) works. To transmit image files from the personal computer (PC) to the DE2-115 board, where they are stored, processed and displayed.

### Preparation

* Revise the first four labs
* Read this document and get familiarized with the source code and the in-lab experiments

### In-lab experiments

- [Experiment 1](experiment1/doc/experiment1.md)
- [Experiment 2](experiment2/doc/experiment2.md)
- [Experiment 3](experiment3/doc/experiment3.md)
- [Experiment 4](experiment4/doc/experiment4.md)

### Evaluation

Take-home exercise:

- [Exercise](exercise/doc/exercise.md) (has a weight of 3% of your final grade)

Because the 3DQ5 midterm test is on Monday, Oct 25, the take-home exercise for this lab is due by the end of the day that falls one week after the in-lab experiments have been done. For example, if you are a Tuesday group, then your take-home exercise is due by the end of day on Tuesday, Oct 26, and so on.
